This project runs on Visual Studio, using a graphics project that was written by a professor and was therefore not included.

The aim of the final project was to have two autonomous 2d cars "chase" one another and fire a laser.
The code analyzes images to distinguish the color of the car, uses a mathematical gradient function to determine it's chasing path and has object detection and avoidance.

The code was written as a final project by 4 team members including myself and therefore it is not all my own development.
