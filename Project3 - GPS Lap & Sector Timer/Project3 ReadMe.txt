This project was written in a project group of 2 and therefore not the entire code is of my development.

The code aims to gather gps coordinates from a gps receiver and setup a lap map with laps and sectors. 
When the driver has setup the sectors and lap on the first lap the code uses relative positioning to determine the subsequent lap/sector times of the vehicle.
