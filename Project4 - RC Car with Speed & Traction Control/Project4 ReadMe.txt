This code was written by myself and a partner for a final project, therefore only part of the code is of my development.

It uses an arduino framework to receive radio messages from an arduino based controller. Which in turn controls the vehicle which contains a DC motor drivetrain and servo steering system.
This code includes PID based functions that act as a speed and traction control for the vehicle.
