This is a portfolio of some of the code that was worked on/improved on or developped by:
Tyler Montcalm

It is important to note that parts of these codes were based on open source code, 
or were worked on in a team and is therefore not completely my own.

These files act as a representation of some of the code that I have developped over the years.

Each ProjectX folder contains a readme that describes what the code aims to accomplish
